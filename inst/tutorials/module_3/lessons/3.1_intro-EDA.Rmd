### What is EDA?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets, typically with visual methods, to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. In EDA, we do not start with a preconceived hypothesis, but rather we let the data guide us and reveal its underlying structure and variables that might be interesting to explore further. EDA is all about making sense of data in hand, understanding patterns, relationships, or even identifying useful features for predictive modeling.  

Let's take an example relevant to IO psychology: Suppose we have a dataset of employee engagement survey results. Before jumping into any specific hypotheses or complex analysis, we would first want to explore this data, understand its structure, see the distribution of responses, check for any interesting patterns or outliers. This is where EDA comes in.  


### Why is EDA important in data analytics?

EDA is a critical step in the data analysis pipeline because it allows us to understand the underlying structure of our data, identify any potential issues (like missing values or outliers), and guide any further analysis. EDA can help us make more informed decisions about how to treat different variables, what kind of modeling approach might be most appropriate, and where we might want to collect more data.  

For instance, suppose in our employee engagement data, we find that a particular department has unusually low scores. This would prompt us to investigate further - could there be an issue with management in this department? Or perhaps the survey was not distributed properly? EDA gives us these leads to follow in our analysis.  


### Understanding the cycle of question asking, analysis, and interpretation

EDA is not a linear process, but rather an iterative one. We start by asking broad questions, perform some initial analysis, interpret the results, then refine our questions and dig deeper. This cycle continues until we have a solid understanding of our data.  

Let's walk through a simple EDA process in R with a hypothetical dataset, `employee_survey`:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)

# View the first few rows of the data
head(employee_survey)

# Summary statistics
summary(employee_survey)

# Visualize the distribution of engagement scores
ggplot(employee_survey, aes(x = engagement_score)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "steelblue", color = "white")

# Explore relationship between engagement score and department
ggplot(employee_survey, aes(x = department, y = engagement_score)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```


In this script, we first load our dataset, examine its structure, compute some summary statistics, and then create a couple of exploratory plots: a histogram of engagement scores and a boxplot comparing scores across departments. Each of these steps might prompt us to ask new questions, refine our analysis, and dive deeper into the data.  


In the next sections, we will explore how to formulate good questions, apply EDA techniques in R, and interpret our findings in a meaningful way for business contexts.
