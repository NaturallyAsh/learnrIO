*This is for internal use for tracking and adjusting module curriculum.*

1.  4.0_overview.Rmd

    1.  Introduction to module
    2.  Required packages
    
2.  4.1_descriptive_statistics **(Likely covered in module 3, EDA)**

    1.  Introduction (Introduction to dataset; visualization example)
    2.  Estimates of central tendency: mean (arithmetic, geometric,
        harmonic), median, and mode
    3.  Estimates of spread: variance, standard deviation
    4.  Higher-order properties of distributions: skew & kurtosis
    5.  Visualizing distributions: histograms, stem & leaf plots,
        box-plots, bar charts, scatterplots, Q-Q plots

3.  4.2_correlation_regression

    1.  Introduction (Two is better than one!)
    2.  Correlation
        1.  Common correlation coefficients (Pearson's *r*, Spearman's
            *rho*)
        2.  Polychoric & terachoric correlations
        3.  Biserial & point-biserial
    3.  Regression
        1.  Simple linear
        2.  Multiple regression
        3.  Generalized linear models
            1.  Logistic regression
            2.  Ordinal regression
            3.  Mention other nonlinear techniques (e.g., lasso/ridge)
                and say we'll come back to it (?)

4.  4.3_hypothesis_testing

    1.  Introduction (z-tests, t-tests, and ANOVAs, oh my!)
    2.  t-tests: independent, paired-sample, other types (?)
        1.  post-hoc tests between groups (?)
    3.  ANOVAs
        1.  Fixed effects, random effects models
        2.  One-way ANOVA
        3.  Factorial ANOVA
        4.  Post-hoc comparisons
    4.  ANCOVAs
    5.  Chi-square (and other nonparametric techniques?)

5.  4.4_mediation_moderation
    
    1. Introduction (putting it all together in an applied or research context)
    2. Testing for mediation in R
        1. Classic test for mediation
        2. Bootstrapping methods
            3. PROCESS in R (?)
    3. Testing moderation in R
    4. More complex situaitons (moderated mediation; refer to another source?)

6.  4.5_outro
    
    1. Congratulations!
    2. Mention factor analysis; will discuss in more detail in the next module
