title: "Topics not covered"
---

Although this course covers a wide range of topics in data analytics with a focus on Industrial-Organizational Psychology, and will serve as a central resource giving students the access to the tools they need to succeed in applied settings, there are several areas that are not covered in the base course.

Advanced statistical techniques such as multilevel modeling and structural equation modeling require a deeper level of statistical expertise and understanding than what is covered in this course. Similarly, advanced psychometric topics such as multidimensional item response theory go beyond the scope of this course. However, we will refer students to already available and excellent resources for those topics not covered. For example, the book "Discovering Statistics using R and RStudio", and its accompanying `discovR` learnr course by Andy Fields, and "Modern Psychometrics with R" by Patrick Mair provide comprehensive coverage of more advanced topics.  

We plan to develop courses for machine learning, natural language processing, people analytics, and advanced psychometrics with R in the future. These courses will cover advanced topics that build upon the foundations taught in this course.
