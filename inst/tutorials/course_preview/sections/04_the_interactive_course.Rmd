Our tutorial provides a strong foundation in statistical and analytical skills that will better prepare students for future studies or career opportunities in the Industrial Organizational Psychology field.  

Our tutorial is designed to be accessible and easy-to-use for both professors and students. We understand that redesigning course curriculums to incorporate R programming can be challenging. Therefore, we have created an interactive course using the learnr R package that professors can use as a supplement to their existing curriculum. The interactive course includes various modules covering topics such as data manipulation, data visualization, regression analysis, and more. The modules are self-paced, interactive, and include quizzes to reinforce students' understanding of the material.
