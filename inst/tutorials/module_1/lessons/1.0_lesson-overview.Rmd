### Welcome! 
This lesson will serve as an introduction to R, RStudio, and Quarto. We will cover the basics of navigating and using R, RStudio, and Quarto for data analytics. 

Before getting started, we **strongly** encourage you to create a Quarto file to work in alongside this course. An Quarto file is a great way to keep track of notes and practice what you learn from the course. By working in a Quarto file, you can write and execute R code, include text, images, and other media, and export your work to a variety of formats (such as HTML or PDF). This allows you to create a comprehensive record of your progress throughout the course.  

This lesson uses the following packages:  
```
some package
```
So, be sure to load these in your Quarto file.



By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:  

  1. Gain familiarity with the R programming language and its applications in data analysis.  
  2. Learn to navigate the RStudio environment, including the script editor, console, and help features.  
  3. Learn to basics of Quarto and understand the role of Quarto in the data analysis workflow.
