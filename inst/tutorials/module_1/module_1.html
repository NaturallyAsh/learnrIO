<h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
<div id="section-welcome" class="section level3">
<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>This lesson will serve as an introduction to R, RStudio, and Quarto.
We will cover the basics of navigating and using R, RStudio, and Quarto
for data analytics.</p>
<p>Before getting started, we <strong>strongly</strong> encourage you to
create a Quarto file to work in alongside this course. An Quarto file is
a great way to keep track of notes and practice what you learn from the
course. By working in a Quarto file, you can write and execute R code,
include text, images, and other media, and export your work to a variety
of formats (such as HTML or PDF). This allows you to create a
comprehensive record of your progress throughout the course.</p>
<p>This lesson uses the following packages:</p>
<pre><code>some package</code></pre>
<p>So, be sure to load these in your Quarto file.</p>
<p>By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Gain familiarity with the R programming language and its
applications in data analysis.<br />
</li>
<li>Learn to navigate the RStudio environment, including the script
editor, console, and help features.<br />
</li>
<li>Learn to basics of Quarto and understand the role of Quarto in the
data analysis workflow.</li>

<h2>Introduction to R and RStudio</h2>
<div id="section-welcome-to-introduction-to-r-and-rstudio"
class="section level3">
<h3>Welcome to <strong>Introduction to R and RStudio!</strong></h3>
</div>
<div id="section-introduction-to-the-r-language" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction to the R language</h3>
<p>R is a powerful programming language that was designed with
statistics and data analysis in mind. It has a rich ecosystem of
packages which can be utilized to perform complex data manipulations,
analyses and visualizations. Moreover, it is highly extensible and
allows you to integrate with other languages (like C++, Python, Julia,
etc.) if needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-introduction-to-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction to RStudio</h3>
<p>RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R,
providing a convenient and user-friendly interface for writing, running,
and debugging R code. It includes several useful features such as syntax
highlighting, code completion, and version control integration. RStudio
makes working with R easier and more enjoyable. RStudio is often used by
I/O psychology practitioners because it simplifies many of the technical
aspects of coding, allowing practitioners to focus more on the insights
gleaned from the data.</p>
<p>It is quite possible you may be thinking, “so, what’s the difference
between R and RStudio? Aren’t they the same thing?” Well, imagine R as a
versatile and powerful kitchen appliance like a food processor, while
RStudio is like a cookbook filled with recipes and step-by-step
instructions on how to use the appliance.</p>
<p>[insert image]</p>
<p>R is the underlying programming language and software environment for
statistical computing and graphics. It’s like a food processor that can
help you perform various tasks such as slicing, chopping, and blending
ingredients. R is what allows you to perform data analysis, create
visualizations, and develop statistical models.</p>
<p>On the other hand, RStudio is an integrated development environment
(IDE) designed to work with R. It’s like a cookbook that teaches you how
to use the food processor (R) effectively, guiding you through the
process of preparing a variety of dishes. RStudio provides features such
as code editing, debugging, and project management, making it easier to
write, run, and organize your R code.</p>

<div id="section-navigating-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>Navigating RStudio</h3>
<div id="section-pane-layout" class="section level4">
<h4>Pane Layout</h4>
<p>RStudio’s interface is divided into four main panes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Script Editor:</strong> This is where you will write and
edit your R scripts. It features syntax highlighting and code
completion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Console:</strong> This is where R code is executed. You
can also type code directly into the console, but it’s often better to
write code in the script editor and then run it, so you have a record of
your code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Environment/History:</strong> The Environment tab shows
your current workspace, including all variables, data frames, and
functions that exist in memory. The History tab shows your command
history.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Files/Plots/Packages/Help:</strong> This pane allows you
to navigate your file system, see plots generated by your code, manage
packages, and access R’s built-in help system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>[Image Placeholder]</p>
<p><br> #### Addins <br></p>
</div>
<div id="section-running-code-in-the-console" class="section level4">
<h4>Running Code in the Console</h4>
<p>To run code from your script editor, you can simply highlight the
code you want to run and press the <code>Run</code> button, or use the
shortcut <code>Ctrl+Enter</code> (<code>Cmd+Enter</code> on Mac). The
code will be sent to and executed in the console.</p>
<p>Let’s run a simple line of code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>print(&quot;Hello, I/O Psychology!&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Hello, I/O Psychology!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>After running this code, the console will display the message “Hello,
I/O Psychology!”.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-environment-pane" class="section level4">
<h4>Environment Pane</h4>
<p>The Environment pane in RStudio is an extremely helpful tool as it
displays all the objects (like vectors, data frames, and functions) that
you’ve created in your R session. You can see the object’s name, class,
length, and content, giving you a quick overview of what’s currently in
your workspace.</p>
<p>Let’s create a simple vector and a data frame to see how they appear
in the Environment pane:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># create a vector of employee ages
employee_ages &lt;- c(25, 30, 35, 40)

# create a data frame of employees
employees &lt;- data.frame(
  id = 1:4,
  age = employee_ages,
  department = c(&quot;HR&quot;, &quot;Marketing&quot;, &quot;Sales&quot;, &quot;IT&quot;)
)</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="section-getting-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting Help</h3>
<p>As you start your journey with R, you will undoubtedly encounter
challenges or unfamiliar tasks. That’s perfectly normal! One of the most
important skills in programming, and especially in data analysis, is
knowing how to find help when you need it. Let’s explore some of the
ways you can get help.</p>
<div id="section-built-in-r-help-system" class="section level4">
<h4>Built-in R Help System</h4>
<p>R has a built-in help system that you can access directly from
RStudio. If you want to know more about a function, you can use the
<code>help()</code> function or the <code>?</code> shortcut, followed by
the name of the function. For example, if we wanted to learn more about
the <code>print()</code> function, we could use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>help(print)
# or 
?print</code></pre>
<p>This will open a help page in the Files/Plots/Packages/Help pane,
providing detailed information about the function.</p>
<p>[Image Placeholder]</p>
</div>
<div id="section-online-resources" class="section level4">
<h4>Online Resources</h4>
<p>While the built-in help system is great for learning about specific
functions, you will often encounter more complex problems or need
broader advice. That’s where online resources come in handy. Here are a
few key ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Google:</strong> Don’t underestimate the power of a
well-phrased Google search! Often, someone else has already encountered
the same problem and found a solution. Try to be as specific as possible
in your search, and include “R” to get more relevant results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stack Overflow:</strong> This is a question-and-answer
website for a wide range of programming topics, including R. You can
search for your problem, and if it hasn’t been asked before, you can
post a new question. Remember to be specific and include a minimal
reproducible example if possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GitHub:</strong> Many R packages are developed openly on
GitHub, and you can often find help and examples in the repository’s
issues or wiki. If you think you’ve found a bug in a package, you can
report it in the issues section.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Package Documentation and Vignettes:</strong> Most R
packages come with detailed documentation and vignettes (long-form
guides). You can access the documentation by using the
<code>help()</code> function or <code>?</code>, and vignettes can be
accessed with the <code>vignette()</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>R-Bloggers:</strong> This is an aggregate of blogs about
R, where you can find tutorials, examples, and advice on a wide range of
topics. <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-bloggers
website</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Twitter:</strong> Many R users and developers are active
on Twitter, using the hashtag #rstats. It’s a great place to ask
questions, share your work, and keep up with the latest developments in
the R community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reddit:</strong> The Reddit community can also be a
helpful resource, particularly the r/rstats and r/RStudio subreddits.
You can post questions, share your work, and engage in discussions with
other R users. As with other online communities, try to be specific in
your questions and provide a reproducible example if possible. Remember,
the goal is to make it as easy as possible for others to understand your
problem and provide help.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Learning to effectively search for help and solutions online is a
valuable skill that will greatly aid your journey into R and data
analysis. The more you practice, the better you’ll become at finding the
information you need.</p>
<p>Remember, everyone starts from scratch and it’s okay not to know
everything. The R community is known for being welcoming and helpful, so
don’t hesitate to ask questions when you’re stuck!</p>

<h2>Project Workflow and Reports using Quarto</h2>
<div id="section-organize-your-work-using-rstudio-projects"
class="section level3">
<h3>Organize Your Work Using RStudio Projects</h3>
<p>Working with data often involves multiple files: data files, code
files, and output files. Keeping these files organized can be a
challenge, especially as a project grows in complexity. RStudio Projects
are a powerful tool to keep your work organized.</p>
<p>[Image Placeholder or instructions to create new project]</p>
<p>When you create a new RStudio Project, RStudio creates a new
directory/folder on your computer. This new directory will contain an
<code>.Rproj</code> file which stores settings related to your project.
When you open this <code>.Rproj</code> file, RStudio will start a new
session with the working directory set to the directory containing the
<code>.Rproj</code> file. This means that you can use relative paths
(paths that do not start with <code>/</code> or <code>~</code>) to your
files which makes your project more portable.</p>
<p>For example, instead of using a full path to read a data file:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;/Users/yourname/Projects/myproject/data/mydata.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You can use a relative path, i.e., the path starting from your
project <code>myproject</code> directory:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/mydata.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>This way, as long as the relative structure of your files remains the
same, you can move your project directory or even share it with others,
and your code will still work!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-creating-a-new-quarto-document" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating a New Quarto Document</h3>
<p>Quarto offers a comprehensive framework for data science authoring,
integrating your code, its results, and your written content. Quarto
documents are fully reproducible and support various output formats,
including HTML web pages, PDFs, Word files, presentations, and more.</p>
<p>Quarto documents serve three primary purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Communication with decision-makers:</strong> These
individuals prioritize understanding the key findings rather than
delving into the technical aspects of the analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collaboration with fellow data
analysts/scientists:</strong> These individuals are interested in both
the conclusions drawn and the underlying code that led to those
conclusions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data science environment:</strong> Quarto serves as a
contemporary lab notebook, allowing you to document not only your
actions but also your thoughts during the data science process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To use Quarto with R, you should install the rmarkdown R package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Installation of the <code>rmarkdown</code> package will also install
the <code>knitr</code> (we’ll come back to <code>knitr</code> later)
package so you will have everything required to render documents
containing R code.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-markdown-basics" class="section level3">
<h3>Markdown Basics</h3>
<p>Markdown is a simple language for formatting text. You can create
headings by starting a line with one or more <code>#</code> symbols
(e.g., <code># Heading 1</code>, <code>## Heading 2</code>). You can
create lists by starting lines with <code>-</code> or <code>*</code>.
You can make text bold or italic by surrounding it with <code>**</code>
or <code>*</code> (e.g., <code>**bold text**</code>,
<code>*italic text*</code>).</p>
<p>You can include links using the following syntax:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>[link text](https://www.example.com)</code></pre>
<p>And you can include images using a similar syntax:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>![image alt text](path/to/image.jpg)</code></pre>
<p><br> [Placeholder for markdown image]<br />
<br></p>
</div>
<div id="section-using-the-visual-editor-with-quarto"
class="section level3">
<h3>Using the Visual Editor with Quarto</h3>
<p>But what if you are new to markdown and prefer a simplier way to
format your document? Well you are in luck!</p>
<p>In addition to the classic source editor (which is what you see when
you first create your new Quarto document), RStudio provides a visual
editor that provides a live preview of your document as you write it.
The visual editor can be a great aid when you’re getting started with
Quarto and markdown, as it allows you to see the results of your
formatting immediately, rather than having to knit the document to see
the final output.</p>
<p><br> [Image placeholder] <br></p>
<p>The visual editor provides several features that can make your
workflow more efficient:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Live Preview:</strong> As you type, you can see a live
rendering of your document. This includes text formatting, code chunks,
images, tables, and other elements of your document.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>WYSIWYG Editing:</strong> You can apply text formatting
(like bold or italics), create lists, insert links, and more using the
toolbar at the top of the editor. You can also insert code chunks and
other special elements using the Insert button on the toolbar.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Chunk Controls:</strong> Code chunks in the visual
editor come with a set of controls that allow you to run the code,
display the output inline, or hide the code or output.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outline View:</strong> The visual editor provides an
outline view of your document, which allows you to quickly navigate to
different sections.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To switch to the visual editor in RStudio, you can use the dropdown
menu in the top-right corner of the source editor pane. Select “Visual
Editor” from this menu, and RStudio will switch to the visual editor for
the current document.</p>
<p>Remember, the visual editor is just another way to interact with your
Quarto document. Whether you use the visual editor or the source editor
is a matter of personal preference and depends on your workflow. You can
switch between the two at any time without affecting your document.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-code-chunks" class="section level3">
<h3>Code Chunks</h3>
<p>In Quarto, code chunks are the parts of the document where you can
include code from various programming languages, such as R, Python, and
SQL. These chunks can be used to perform computations, create
visualizations, and more. The output of the code chunk (if any) is then
included directly in the document.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic example of a code chunk in Quarto:</p>
<!--

````r
```{r}
print("Hello world!")
```
````
-->
<pre class="{{r}}"><code>print(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>When you knit your document, the code in the code chunk will be
executed and the results will be included in the output document.</p>
<p>You can control the behavior of code chunks with chunk options, which
are specified in the <code>{r}</code> part of the chunk header.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most commonly used chunk options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>echo</code></strong>: Determines whether the code
in the chunk should be included in the final document. If
<code>echo=FALSE</code>, the code will be executed, but the code itself
won’t be shown in the document, only its output.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>eval</code></strong>: Determines whether the code
in the chunk should be executed. If <code>eval=FALSE</code>, the code
won’t be executed, and no output will be included in the
document.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>include</code></strong>: Determines whether the
chunk (both the code and the output) should be included in the final
document. If <code>include=FALSE</code>, the chunk will be completely
ignored when the document is rendered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>fig.cap</code></strong>: Provides a caption for any
figures that are produced by the code chunk.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Quarto introduces a new way to specify chunk options (well, new if
you have not used R Markdown before). Instead of including them on the
same line as the backticks and language identifier, you can include them
in special comments at the top of the code chunk. For example:</p>
<p>In this example, <code>echo: false</code> is a chunk option that
tells Quarto not to include the code in the final output, and
<code>fig-cap: "Air Quality"</code> is a chunk option that provides a
caption for a figure produced by the code chunk.</p>
<p>This way of specifying chunk options makes it easier to include
longer options like <code>fig-cap</code>, <code>fig-subcap</code>, and
<code>fig-alt</code>. It also improves compatibility with more
structured editors that don’t have an easy way to edit chunk metadata
(e.g., most traditional notebook UIs).</p>
<p>That being said, if you prefer, you can still include chunk options
on the first line (e.g., <code>{r, echo = FALSE}</code>). However, we
recommend using the comment-based syntax to make your documents more
portable and consistent across execution environments.</p>
<p>For more detailed information about Quarto chunk options, you can
refer to the <a href="https://yihui.org/knitr/options/">chunk options
documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-yaml-and-output-formats" class="section level3">
<h3>YAML and Output Formats</h3>
<p>At the top of a Quarto document, you’ll find a block of text
surrounded by <code>---</code>. This is the YAML metadata for the
document. It specifies options for the document, such as the output
format. For example, here’s a YAML block for a document specifying the
title and that the output should be in HTML format:</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>---
title: &quot;My Document&quot;
format: html_document
---</code></pre>
<p>The <code>format</code> field specifies the output format. You can
specify multiple formats by listing them:</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>---
title: &quot;My Document&quot;
format: 
  - html_document
  - pdf_document
---</code></pre>
