title: "Basic R Concepts and Data Structures"
---

### Introduction

In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of R programming. We'll unpack the concept of objects, a term that in R includes numbers, character strings, vectors, lists, matrices, arrays, data frames, and functions. In parallel, we'll learn about data types, which define the kind of data that can be stored in an object, such as integers, numerics, logicals, characters, and factors.  

Why is this fundamental understanding crucial for any R programmer? Let's unravel the four key reasons:  

1. **Efficient data manipulation:** Recognizing data types and objects paves the way for effective data wrangling. Knowing when to use a matrix, a data frame, or a tibble can significantly impact the speed and efficiency of your code.  

2. **Error prevention:** Errors in R often surface from incompatible data types or structures. A deep comprehension of data types and how they behave can help you prevent these roadblocks.  

3. **Better code readability:** Code is read more often than it is written. Hence, writing clean and easily understandable code is paramount. Using appropriate data types and structures makes your code easier to read and understand, not just for others but also for your future self.

4. **Enhanced performance:** Different data types and structures have unique performance characteristics. Choosing the most appropriate data type for your needs can enhance the efficiency of your code, making it faster and more robust.  


As we go through this lesson, you'll get a chance to work with these concepts directly, reinforcing your understanding and building your skills in data manipulation and analysis in R.  


### R Objects and Variables

In R, objects and variables are fundamental components used to store and manipulate data. They provide a way to refer to values or entities within the program. Let's delve into each concept separately:  

1. **Objects**: In R, an object is a data structure that holds a value or a set of values. Objects can represent various types of data, such as numbers, strings, vectors, matrices, data frames, and more complex structures. Each object has a unique name (variable name) that can be used to refer to it and perform operations on its associated data.  

2. **Variables**: Variables serve as placeholders or containers for storing objects in memory. They are essentially names that are assigned to objects. By using variables, you can easily reference and manipulate the associated objects without explicitly using their names every time.  

Assigning objects to variables is accomplished using the assignment operator, which is denoted by the <- symbol. Here's the general syntax:    

```{r, eval=FALSE}
variable <- object
```

For example, let's say we have an object `x` containing the value 10, and we want to assign it to a variable `my_variable`:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 10
my_variable <- x
```

In this case, we assign the value of `x` (which is 10) to the variable `my_variable`. Now, `my_variable` holds the same value as `x`. Click the "run code" button in the following code block to view the result:  

```{r object-setup}
x <- 10
my_variable <- x
```

```{r object, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=2}
x <- 10
my_variable <- x
```

You will notice that it seems like nothing happened after clicking "run code". Something DID happen! We assigned object `x` to `my_variable`, but in order to print (view) the result, you must type `my_variable` on a line by itself. Go ahead and type `my_variable` in the code box below, then click "run code":  

```{r view-object, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="object-setup", exercise.lines=2}

```

```{r view-object-solution}
my_variable
```


<div class="callout">
**Note**: You can assign a value to a variable and print the variable all in one line of code by enclosing them in parentheses (e.g., ```(my_variable <- x)```). 
</div>
 

###
Variables can be assigned objects of any type. Here's another example, assigning a character string to a variable. Click the "run code" button to view the result. **Don't forget to print the variable!**:  

```{r hello, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=2}
hello_message <- "Hello World!"
```

```{r hello-solution}
hello_message <- "Hello World!"
hello_message
```


### Naming Variables

You should aim to make your variable names describe what they store (e.g., a name of `height_values` describing heights). Variable names must start with a letter and can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and periods. You should also make your variable names lowercase and **snake_case** (using an underscore to separate words in a variable name). 

```{r, naming-vars, eval=FALSE}
# Naming variables
age <- 25 # Good!
AGE <- 25 # Bad; should be lowercase

name <- "Alice" # Good!
_name <- "Alice" # Bad; do not start with underscore

height <- 1.70 # Good!
17_height <- # Bad; do not start with numbers

is_student <- TRUE # Good!
is_this_a_student <- TRUE # Bad; too long
```


Where possible, avoid using names of existing functions and variables (i.e., table, seq, data). Doing so will cause confusion for the readers of your code.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# ALL BAD!
mean <- sum(x, y) 
data <- read.csv("data.csv")
T <- FALSE
```


When it comes to naming variables, the most important thing is to remain consistent.



###

Functions in R are objects that perform a specific task or operation on data. They take one or more objects as input (often referred to as arguments or parameters), manipulate data in a defined way, and then return a result.   

Lets look at the following code block. We assign the number 5 to the `x` variable and the number 4 to the `y` variable.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
y <- 4
```

`sum()` is an R built-in function. We can input `x` and `y` as the `sum()` function's arguments to get a result that sums the two variable's values. In the following code block, type `sum(x,y)` and click the "run code" button to view the result:  

```{r sum-setup}
x <- 5
y <- 4
```

```{r sum, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=1}

```

```{r sum-solution}
sum(x, y)
```

In the above codeblock, the `sum()` function takes the value of object `x` and the value of object `y` and returns the sum of the two values.  

When working in RStudio, you can access any built-in function and package function's documenation from the help pane.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}

```

We will dive deeper into functions in the lesson.  


###

R supports a wide array of operations and functions that we can perform on our variables. These include but are not limited to:  

- Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `%%`)  
- Comparison operations (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`)  
- Logical operations (`&`, `|`, `!`)  
- Basic mathematical functions (`abs()`, `sqrt()`, `exp()`, `log()`, `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`)  

Consider the following variables containing an employee's salary, age, and department:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
employee_salary <- 55000
employee_age <- 38
employee_dept <- "HR"
```

We can perform operations on these employee variables:  

```{r operations-setup}
employee_salary <- 55000
employee_age <- 38
employee_dept <- "HR"
```

```{r operations, exercise=TRUE}
employee_salary * 1.05
employee_age > 40
employee_dept == "IT"
sqrt(employee_age)
```

These operations and functions allow you to manipulate and transform your data, extract meaningful information from it, and perform complex mathematical and statistical calculations.  


### Data types

R data types in define the kind of information a variable stores. The common data types are numeric, integer, character, logical, and factor.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
reactable::reactable(table_types, bordered = TRUE)
```


You can use the `typeof()` function to determine the data type of a variable. Take the following code block for example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
salary <- 26890.90
age <- 55
first_name <- "Michael"
current_employee <- TRUE
employee_level <- factor("entry")
```

Using the `typeof()` function, print the data type of each variable. Click the "run code" button to view the results:  

```{r typeof-setup}
salary <- 26890.90
age <- 55
first_name <- "Michael"
current_employee <- TRUE
employee_level <- factor("entry")
```

```{r typeof, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=6}

```

```{r typeof-hint}
typeof(salary)
typeof(___)
typeof(___)
typeof(___)
typeof(___)
```

```{r typeof-solution}
typeof(salary)
typeof(age)
typeof(first_name)
typeof(current_employee)
typeof(employee_level)
```

In some cases, you may need to convert between data types. R provides several functions for type conversion, such as `as.integer()`, `as.numeric()`, `as.character()`, and `as.logical()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
age <- "52"
typeof(age)

new_age <- as.integer(age)
typeof(new_age)
```

We will dive deeper into data type conversions in a later lesson.  


### Data structures 

R has several data structures to store and organize data. These include Vectors, Lists, Matrices, Arrays, Factors, and Data Frames.

 * **Atomic Vectors:** Atomic vectors are one-dimensional arrays of data that can contain elements of the same data type, such as numbers or characters.  
 * **Matrices:** Matrices are two-dimensional arrays that can contain elements of the same data type. They are created using the `matrix()` function.  
 * **Arrays:** Arrays are similar to matrices but can have any number of dimensions. They are created using the `array()` function.  
 * **Data frames:** Data frames are two-dimensional tables that can contain columns of different data types (numeric, character, logical, etc.). They are similar to matrices but are more flexible in terms of the types of data they can hold.  
 * **Lists:** Lists (also known as Recursive Vectors) are collections of objects that can be of different data types. They can contain any combination of vectors, matrices, arrays, data frames, or even other lists.  
 * **Factors:** Factors are used to represent categorical data in R.

While R has several data structures available, for the purpose of this lesson, we will focus primarily on vectors, lists, factors, and data frames, all fundamental building blocks in R.  


###
#### Atomic Vectors
Atomic vectors are the most basic data structure in R. An atomic vector's values can be one of 6 data types: logical, integer, double, character, complex, and raw. We can be create atomic vectors using the `c()` (combine or concat) function:  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
character_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```

Notice that the `numeric_vector` and `character_vector` each contain elements of the *same* data type; number elements and character elements, respectively.  

In the codeblock below, create a numeric vector with the values `25`, `30`, `35`, and `40`. Assign the vector to a variable named `ages`. Click the "run code" button to view the result.  
```{r numeric-vec, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=2}

```

```{r numeric-vec-hint}
ages <- c(25, 30, 35, 40)
ages
```

```{r numeric-vec-solution}
ages <- c(25, 30, 35, 40)
ages
```

Now create a character vector with the values `HR`, `Sales`, `Marketing`, and `Finance`. Assign the vector to a variable named `departments`. Print the variable. Click the "run code" button to view the result:  

```{r char-vec, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=2}

```

```{r char-vec-hint}
departments <- c("HR", ___, ___, ___)
departments
```

```{r char-vec-solution}
departments <- c("HR", "Sales", "Marketing", "Finance")
departments
```


**Accessing Vector Elements**  
You can access a single value (or element) from a vector by using square brackets `[]`. This method of accessing elements of a vector (and other data structures) is called *indexing* or *subsetting*. We will go into more detail about indexing and subsetting in a later lesson. But as a quick demonstration, we can look at `departments`.  

To retrieve the "HR" element, specify the number that indicates it's position in the vector. So, there are four elements in `departments`. "HR" is in the 1 position, "Sales" is in the 2 position, and so forth.  

```{r}
departments[1]
```

In the codeblock below, retrieve the "Marketing" element from `departments`. Click "run code" to view the result.  

```{r index-vector-setup}
departments <- c("HR", "Sales", "Marketing", "Finance")
```

```{r index-vector, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r index-vector-hint}
departments[___]
```

```{r index-vector-solution}
departments[3]
```


###
#### Lists 
Lists are often used to store complex data structures and can contain a mixture of data types (whereas atomic vectors can only contain one data type). Lists can also be referred to as **recursive vectors** because lists can contain other lists. When I say recursive, think of it as something that "reoccurs" over and over again, like those fun house mirrors that are angled to present an infinite number of images. So, a list can contain a list, which can contain another list, which can contain another list, and so on to infinity.  

We create lists using the `list()` function:  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
regular_list <- list("John Doe", 25, TRUE) # Mixture of data types

named_list <- list(name = "John Doe", age = 25, is_student = TRUE) # Give objects names

```

Notice that the object values in `regular_list` and `named_list` are the same. However, `named_list` assigns **names** to those objects. You can better understand the difference between the two lists using `str()`.  

Something to note is that you will often work with lists containing hundreds or thousands of data objects and values. Printing a list object (typing `regular_list`, for example) is not very informative. There are two better ways to for inspecting lists:  

- Using the `str()` function.  
- Viewing the list object in the "Environment Pane".  
  

In the codeblock below, call `str()` twice; the first with `regular_list` as an argument and the second with `named_list` as an argument. Run the code to view the results and see if you can spot the difference:  

```{r basic-list-setup}
regular_list <- list("John Doe", 25, TRUE)

named_list <- list(name = "John Doe", age = 25, is_student = TRUE) 
```

```{r basic-list, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r basic-list-hint}
str(regular_list)
str(___)
```

```{r basic-list-solution}
str(regular_list)
str(named_list)
```


When working out of RStudio, you can easily view a list object's structure by going to the Environment Pane and "uncollapsing" the list object:

  <figcaption class="figcap">List Object in Environment Pane</figcaption>
</figure>

**Note**:

**Indexing Elements in a List**  
Indexing elements in lists is similar to indexing them in vectors - using single brackets `[]`. However, because of complexity of lists compared to vectors, double brackets `[[]]` needed in order to drill down and access individual list elements.  

Let's use an employee list object as an example. Use the codeblock to take a look at the structure of `employee_list_data`. *Hint: use the function that makes viewing lists easier*. Click "run code" to view the result.  

```{r index-lists-setup}
employee_list_data <- list(
  id = c("E001", "E002", "E003"),
  name = c("John Doe", "Jane Smith", "Alice Johnson"),
  age = c(30, 35, 28),
  department = c("Finance", "Marketing", "HR")
)
```

```{r inspect-list, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="index-lists-setup"}

```

```{r inspect-list-hint}
str(___)
```

```{r inspect-list-solution}
str(employee_list_data)
```

Viewing `employee_list_data` shows a named list of 4: `id`, `name`, `age`, and `department`. We can use `[]` to extract the `age` named element:  

```{r single-bracket, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="index-lists-setup"}
employee_list_data["age"]
```

Notice that when we inspect the structure of the extracted `age` element:  
```{r str-single-bracket, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="index-lists-setup"}
str(employee_list_data["age"])
```

`age` is still a list! When using the `[]`, the result is a new list containing the element at the specified index.  

We can also use `[]` to extract multiple elements:  
```{r multi-single-bracket, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="index-lists-setup"}
str(employee_list_data[c("id", "age")])
```

Say we want to extract the third employee's name. Using the `[[]]`, we can drill down and retrieve the individual element:  
```{r}
str(employee_list_data[["name"]][3])
```

In the above codeblock, we are saying, "hey, drill down into the `name` and access the third element." Also notice that the result is no longer a list type, but the type of the element; in this case, the result is "Alice Johnson" of character type.  


**The `$` Shorthand**  
The `$ shorthand provides a convenient way to directly access a named element from a list.  
```{r}
employee_list_data$ages
```

The result from using `$` is a vector containing the ages of the employees.  


The $ shorthand can also be used to access a single element within a named element:  
```{r}
employee_list_data$ages[1]
```

Here we retrieved the age of the first employee by specifying the index `[1]`.  

Please note that the `$` shorthand can only be used when the element names are syntactically valid variable names. If the element names contain spaces or special characters, you would need to resort to using single brackets `[]` or double brackets `[[]]` for accessing those elements.  



###
#### Factors
Factors can be thought of as a vector of integers where each integer corresponds to a specific category.  

**Creating Factors**  
```{r create-factors-setup}
department <- c("Research and Development", "HR", "Marketing", "Administrative", "Legal", "IT", "HR", "Administrative", "HR")
department_factor <- factor(department)
```

They are created using the `factor()` function. The simplest way to create a factor is to call is with a vector:  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
department <- c("Research and Development", "HR", "Marketing", "Administrative", "Legal", "IT", "HR", "Administrative", "HR")
department_factor <- factor(department)
```

You can quickly verify whether an object is a factor or not using `is.factor()`. Run this function twice on the `department` and `department_factor` in the codeblock below:  

```{r is-factor, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="create-factors-setup"}

```

```{r is-factor-hint}
is.factor(___)
is.factor(___)
```

```{r is-factor-solution}
is.factor(department)
is.factor(department_factor)
```

You can use `levels()` to view the factor levels. To avoid the pain of manually counting your factors in the case that you have, for example, 10 or more, `str()` is a convenient function that displays the total number of factor levels.  

In the codeblock, print the result of both the `levels()` and `str()` of `department_factor`:  

```{r levels-factor, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="create-factors-setup"}

```

```{r levels-factor-hint}
levels(___)
str(___)
```

```{r levels-factor-solution}
levels(department_factor)
str(department_factor)
```

Note that the `factor()` function creates levels that are sorted in alphabetical order.  


**Reordering Factors**  
Sometimes, the default alphabetical order of levels doesn't make sense for your data. For example, suppose we have a factor representing a rating: "Low", "Medium", "High". Alphabetically, these would be ordered "High", "Low", "Medium", which is not meaningful. To properly order these levels, we can set `ordered = TRUE` as the `factor()` function's argument:  

```{r}
rating <- c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Medium", "High", "Low")
rating_factor <- factor(rating, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))

rating_factor
```

In the output, notice how the levels are now in a meaningful order.  

**Recoding Factors**  
Another common operation is recoding factors. That is, changing the values of some levels. Suppose, for instance, we want to change "HR" to "Human Resources" in our `department_factor` variable. Here is how you can do it:  

```{r}
levels(department_factor)[levels(department_factor) == "HR"] <- "Human Resources"

department_factor
```

In the above codeblock, `levels(department_factor)` returns all the levels of the `department_factor` variable. `levels(department_factor)[levels(department_factor) == "HR"]` indexes the levels of `department_factor` where the value is "HR". Finally, `<- "Human Resources"` assigns the value "Human Resources" to the indexed level(s).  



###
#### Date frames
A data frame is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure where each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column. It can be created using the `data.frame()` function:  
```{r}
employees <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dan"),
  age = c(20, 21, 32, 28),
  employee_level = factor(c("entry", "entry", "senior", "mid")),
  is_terminated = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
)
employees
```

However, for the purposes of this tutorial, we'll actually be using a modernized version of data frames called tibbles. Tibbles are a part of the tidyverse package, and they're preferred over data frames for several reasons:  

- They don't convert character vectors into factors.  
- They allow you to use non-standard variable names.  
- They handle missing and unusual data more gracefully.

We can convert a data frame into a tibble using dplyr's `as_tibble()` function. In the codeblock, print the `employees` data frame by itself and then call the `as_tibble()` function on `employees`. Run the code:  
```{r frame-tibble-setup}
employees <- data.frame(
  name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dan"),
  age = c(20, 21, 32, 28),
  employee_level = factor(c("entry", "entry", "senior", "mid")),
  is_terminated = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
)
```

```{r frame-tibble, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=2}

```

```{r frame-tibble-hint}
employees
as_tibble(employees)
```

```{r frame-tibble-solutino}
employees
as_tibble(employees)
```

Do you notice the differences between the data frame and tibble output? Tibbles output a much cleaner glimpse of your data to the console. The output also prints the structure and column types of your data, which can be very useful for quick inspections.  


We will revisit tibbles in greater detail in future lessons, as they are an integral part of data manipulation and analysis using the `tidyverse`.
