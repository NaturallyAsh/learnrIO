  Version 2.1: 
    Todos:
      Add ### after in-lesson exercise codeblocks. Put follow-up info about the codeblock there.

      Note - Figure out a home to add detailed info on creating user-defined functions.

      Consider spinkling ggplot viz throughout all modules. Make it more interesting for the learners. Keep the 2.7 module for in-depth viz.
      
      Include cheatsheets (i.e., lubridate, dplyr, etc.) at the end of each section as needed.

      Recommend learners use ChatGPT as a resource.

      2.1 - basic concepts:
        NOTE - info from https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/ will be extremely useful for further developing this section.

        ☐ Add somewhere info about executing a function without assigning it to a variable as a way to quickly print to console. Play with and view code results without the inconvenience of needing to `rm()` a variable. Maybe add to the "Functions" section. @created(23-05-27)
        ☐ Add info on using the `summary()` function on vectors and tibbles. Overall inspection and viewing NAs. @created(23-06-16)
        ☐ Add resources/recommendations for more detailed learning of concept @created(23-05-27)
      2.4 - tidy:
        ☐ revisit. Add more stuff or consider combining lesson with another @created(23-06-02)
        ☐ @created(23-06-08)
      2.5 - transforming:
        ☐ add more usage of `glimpse()`. Very useful (especially for a lot of columns) for viewing types of literally all columns instead of trunnecated version @created(23-06-10)
        ☐ in "Handle Missing Data" section, include using `filter()` to filter missing data. e.g., `filter(!is.na(variable))` @created(23-06-16)
        ☐ add gifs for joining data section from here: https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain @created(23-06-17)
      2.6 - text:
        ☐ see todo in Regex section (add resource for practicing regex online) @created(23-06-22)
      References module:
        Citations - create .bib file. Add bibliography to yaml
        ☐ Hadley Wickham https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html @created(23-06-09)

  ✔ Probably should move the Tibbles section at the end of 2.3 to 2.4-Wrangling @created(23-05-31) @done(23-06-17 18:06) @project(Projects.Version 2.1.Todos.2.3 - importing)
  ✔ ~~Need to handle **datasets situation**. `usethis_data()` or in tutorial folder, etc.~~ will put data in "extdata" folder for now. Call in setup chunk. Or in module exercises, call using `system.file("extdata", "dataset.csv", package = "learnrIO", mustWork = TRUE)` @created(23-06-11) @done(23-06-15 15:38) @project(Projects.Version 2.1.Todos)

  ✔ Include info about tidyverse package loading options (individually `library(dplyr`) or all `library(tidyverse)`). Explain it's just a matter of preference or convenience. @created(23-05-27 16:09) @done(23-05-31 19:53) @project(Projects.Version 2.1.Todos.2.2 - tidyverse)
